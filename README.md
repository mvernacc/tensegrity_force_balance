# Tensegrity Force Balance

Calculate force balances for [tensegrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity) structures.

This library only supports the simplest structure, with two rigid bodies.
The original author ([Matt Vernacchia](https://github.com/mvernacc)) has no intention of extending it to more complex structures,
but pull requests to do so would be welcomed.
